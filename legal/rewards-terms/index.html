Net Merchandise Purchases does not include cash withdrawals or any associated fees, charges, traveler’s checks, money orders or associated fees, money transfers or other fees, gaming chips, or fees or premiums for coverage or insurance to protect the balances of an Atlas Account holder’s Atlas Account.</p>
<p>Merchants who accept the Atlas Card are assigned a merchant code, which is determined by the merchant or its processor in accordance with card brand procedures based on the kinds of products and services they primarily sell. As such, even though a merchant may sell retail items that may be similar to retail items sold by another merchant, the merchants may not have the same merchant code, and therefore the purchases at the merchants may not be included in the same category for the purposes of earning points. Net Merchandise Purchases must be submitted by merchants using the identified merchant category codes to qualify for earning points. We are not responsible for incorrectly coded transactions. Additionally, purchases made through third parties, including resellers, or using a third-party payment account may not be eligible for accruing points. Atlas reserves the right to remove merchants from the Reward Program in its sole discretion including when required by local laws, rules, or regulations.
Questions concerning eligible transactions and what constitutes Net Merchandise Purchases will be determined in the sole discretion of Atlas.</p>
<p>The points You earn will be credited to Your Atlas Rewards account after full payment of the applicable monthly balance during which they were earned. We encourage You to frequently review Your Atlas Rewards account, accessible through the Atlas mobile application. Once posted to Your Atlas Rewards account, these points are available to You should You choose to redeem them. There is no limit on the number of points You can earn each year. You cannot earn points during any period in which Your Atlas Account is not open or is not in Good Standing (defined below). If it has been more than thirty (30) days since full payment of the applicable monthly balance and points are not reflected on Your Atlas Rewards account summary, please contact customer service. Inquiries must be made within sixty (60) days of the transaction. “Good Standing” means an Atlas Account or Atlas Card that is not designated by Atlas as lost, stolen, revoked or closed or is not otherwise in default of any of the terms of the Agreement.</p>
<p>No points will be retroactively applied to Your Atlas Rewards account for otherwise qualifying transactions occurring during any period in which Your Atlas Account was not in Good Standing or when you were not enrolled into this Program. All transactions in U.S. Dollars for which points are awarded to You will be rounded to a whole-dollar amount for purposes of determining the number of points to be awarded. You will automatically begin earning points upon opening Your Atlas Account and enrolling in the Atlas Rewards Program, subject to Atlas approval of such enrollment request. You may notify Atlas that You want to withdraw from the Program at any time.</p>
<p>The Rewards balance will be made available through the Atlas mobile application. Individual transactions forming the basis for awarding points will not be shown on the Rewards balance — only total points earned less any point reduction for refunds, returns or adjustments, redeemed points and expiring points will be displayed. The frequency, timing, content or layout of the Rewards statements are subject to change from time-to-time at the discretion of Atlas. Points cannot be combined with other discount or reward programs unless specifically authorized by us.</p>
<h2>Redemption</h2>
<p>You may redeem any points credited to the Rewards by using the Atlas mobile application. Redemptions are subject to point availability and other requirements contained in these Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>Your points will not be available for redemption until posted to Your Atlas Rewards account regardless of the date of the transaction for which points are earned.</p>
<p>Your points may only be redeemed if Your Atlas Account and Your Atlas Rewards account are in Good Standing at the time of any point redemption. Points earned in connection with an enrolled Atlas Account will be consolidated and reported in your Rewards. Consolidation of points into your Rewards will be based upon the person, as determined by Atlas, identified by name and social security number as the primary account holder on each Atlas Account. The primary account holder is the individual whose name appears first on the Atlas Account, as determined by Atlas’s records.</p>
<p>Points may be redeemed for statement credits (“Statement Credit Redemption”). Statement Credit Redemption provides a specific U.S. Dollar amount that, upon redemption of points, is applied as a credit to Your Atlas Account, the current redemption value of Rewards is available on the Atlas website. A Statement Credit Redemption credited to Your Atlas Account will not substitute for Your payment obligations under the Agreement. Statement Credit Redemptions  will generally be credited to Your Atlas Account within two (2) business days of Your redemption.</p>
<p>Points are not Your property and may not be assigned or transferred to any person (including upon death or as a part of a domestic relations matter). Points have neither cash value, surrender value, transfer value nor any other value of any kind until and to the extent they are actually redeemed by Atlas. Points cannot be used to offset any amount due from You to Atlas on the Atlas Account. Points used by You for redemption will be those unredeemed points that have been Rewards the longest time. Points earned by You may only be redeemed for a Statement Credit Redemption (a &quot;Redemption Reward&quot; or &quot;Reward&quot;). All redemptions are final. The sale or barter of any points, other than by Atlas, is expressly prohibited.</p>
