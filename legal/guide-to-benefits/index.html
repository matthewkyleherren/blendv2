<p>Have You ever been waiting for Your Checked Luggage to come around the belt only to find that it has been lost by Your airline?</p>
<p>Fortunately, Lost Luggage Reimbursement is here to help. With Lost Luggage Reimbursement, You can be reimbursed for the difference between the “value of the amount claimed” and the Common Carrier’s payment up to <strong>three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) per Covered Trip (for New York residents, coverage is limited to two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) per bag</strong>, provided the Checked Luggage and/or Carry-on Baggage and/or its contents was lost due to theft or misdirection by the Common Carrier. “Value of the amount claimed” is the lesser of the following three amounts: the original purchase price of the item(s), the actual cash value of the item(s) at the time of theft or misdirection (with appropriate deduction for depreciation), and the cost to replace the item(s).</p>
<p>You and Your Immediate Family Members are all eligible for this benefit when You take a Covered Trip and pay for the cost of Your Common Carrier tickets with Your eligible card issued in the United States and/or rewards program associated with Your covered Account.

</div> <div class="markdown" data-astro-cid-cnvtppup><h2>Auto Rental Collision Damage Waiver</h2>
<p>No cardholder wants to incur the expense of repairing or replacing a rented car. But accidents do happen, and vehicles do get stolen. No matter what happens to Your rental car, You can be covered with Auto Rental Collision Damage Waiver.</p>
<p>Auto Rental Collision Damage Waiver reimburses You for damages caused by theft or collision -- up to the Actual Cash Value of rental vehicles with an original manufacturer’s suggested retail price of up to seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000.00) when new. Auto Rental Collision Damage Waiver covers no other type of loss. For example, in the event of a collision involving Your rented vehicle, damage to any other driver’s car or the injury of anyone or anything is not covered. Rental periods of fifteen (15) consecutive days within Your country of residence, and thirty-one (31) consecutive days outside it, are both covered. (Longer rental periods, however, are not covered).</p>
<p>You are eligible for this benefit if Your name is embossed on an eligible card issued in the United States and You use it to initiate and complete Your entire car rental transaction. Only You as the primary car renter and any additional drivers permitted by the Rental Car Agreement are covered.</p>
<h3>How Auto Rental Collision Damage Waiver Works</h3>
<p>Your Auto Rental Collision Damage Waiver benefit acts as primary coverage and covers theft, damage, valid loss-of-use charges imposed and substantiated by the auto rental company, administrative fees and reasonable and customary towing charges, due to a covered theft or damage to the nearest qualified repair facility.</p>
<h3>How to use Auto Rental Collision Damage Waiver</h3>
<ol>
<li>Use Your card to initiate and complete Your entire car rental transaction.</li>
<li>Review the auto rental agreement and decline the rental company’s collision damage waiver (CDW/LDW) option, or a similar provision, <strong>as accepting this coverage will cancel out Your benefit</strong>. If the rental company insists that You purchase their insurance or collision damage waiver, <strong>call the Benefit Administrator for assistance at 1-800-546-9806. Outside the United States, call collect at 1-804-673-7481</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>Before You leave the lot, be sure to check the car for any prior damage.</strong></em></p>
<p>This benefit is in effect during the time the rental car is in Your (or an authorized driver’s) control, and it terminates when the rental company reassumes control of their vehicle.</p>
<p>This benefit is available in the United States and most foreign countries (with the exception of Israel, Jamaica, the Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland). However, this benefit is not available where precluded by law, or where it’s in violation of the territory terms of the auto rental agreement, or when prohibited by individual merchants. Because regulations vary outside the United States, check with Your auto rental company and the Benefit Administrator before You travel, to be sure that Auto Rental Collision Damage Waiver will apply.</p>
<h3>Vehicles <em>not</em> covered</h3>
<p>Certain vehicles are <em><strong>not</strong></em> covered by this benefit, they consist of expensive, exotic, and antique cars; cargo vans; certain vans; vehicles with an open cargo bed; trucks; motorcycles; mopeds; motorbikes; limousines; and recreational vehicles.</p>
<p>An <strong>expensive automobile</strong> is defined as any vehicle with an original manufacturer’s suggested retail price of more than seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000.00) when new.</p>
<p>An <strong>antique car</strong> is defined as one that is over twenty (20) years old, or one that has not been manufactured for ten (10) years or more.</p>
<p>Vans are not covered. But those designed as small-group transportation vehicles (seating up to nine (9) people, including the driver) are covered.</p>
<h3>If You have questions about a specific vehicle’s coverage or organization where the vehicle is being reserved,  call the Benefit Administrator at 1-800-546-9806, or call collect outside the United States at 1-804-673-7481 collect.</h3>

</div> <div class="markdown" data-astro-cid-cnvtppup><h2>Extended Warranty Protection</h2>
<p>Product warranties can be inconvenient and cumbersome to use. Let’s say You purchased a great gadget about a year ago, but it just stopped working, and You can’t find Your sales receipt and warranty information. For all too common situations like these, Extended Warranty Protection can help.</p>
<p>Extended Warranty Protection provides You with valuable features that help You manage, use and extend the warranties for eligible items purchased on Your covered Account and/or rewards program associated with Your covered Account. Services include Warranty Registration and Extended Protection.  You are eligible for this benefit if You are a cardholder of an eligible card issued in the United States and You purchase either a portion or the entire cost of the item using Your Account and/or rewards program associated with Your covered Account.</p>
<h3>Here’s how Warranty Registration works</h3>
<p>When You purchase an eligible item that carries a manufacturer’s warranty, You can register Your purchase by calling <strong>1-888-221-3289</strong>. You can also register Your purchase online at <a href="https://www.cardbenefitservices.com/">www.cardbenefitservices.com</a>.</p>
<p>The Benefit Administrator will tell You where to send Your item’s sales receipt and warranty information, so they can be kept on file should You need them.</p>
<p>If You choose <em><strong>not</strong></em> to register Your item, be sure to keep Your monthly billing statement reflecting the purchase, the itemized sales receipt, the original manufacturer’s written U.S. warranty and any additional warranty in a safe place. These documents will be required to verify Your claim.</p>
<h3>Here’s how Extended Protection works</h3>
<p>Your warranty coverage can be extended by one (1) additional year on eligible warranties of three (3) years or less. For example, a manufacturer’s warranty of three (3) months would be provided with an additional twelve (12) months of coverage for a combined total of fifteen (15) months of coverage, and a warranty for six (6) months would be provided with an additional twelve (12) months of coverage for a combined total  of eighteen (18) months of coverage. However, if the manufacturer’s warranty is for three (3) years, it would only be extended one (1) additional year for a combined total of four (4) years of coverage.</p>
<p>This benefit is limited to no more than the original price of the purchased item (as shown on Your credit card receipt), less shipping and handling fees, up to a maximum of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) per claim, and fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) per cardholder.</p>

</div> <div class="markdown" data-astro-cid-cnvtppup><h2>Cellular Telephone Protection</h2>
<p>Cell phones have become an everyday necessity for the average person, which means if Your cell phone is damaged or stolen, getting it repaired or replaced is not optional.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Cellular Telephone Protection is available which provides coverage for damage to, theft of, or involuntary and accidental parting of Your cell phone. An involuntary and accidental parting is the unintended separation from Your cell phone when its location is known, but recovery is impractical to complete. This benefit is available if You are a valid cardholder of an eligible U.S. issued card enrolled in the Cellular Telephone Protection benefit and You charge Your monthly cellular wireless phone bills to Your eligible card for the billing cycle before the month in which the incident occurs. Eligible cell phones are the lines listed on Your most recent cellular wireless service provider’s (“cell phone provider”)   monthly billing statement for the billing cycle prior to when the incident occurred.</p>
<h3>What is covered?</h3>
<p>This benefit is supplemental coverage, which means that it will reimburse You for theft of, damage to or involuntary and accidental parting of Your cell phone not otherwise covered by another insurance policy (for example; cell phone insurance programs, or Your homeowner’s, renter’s, automobile, or employer’s insurance policies).</p>
<p>If You <em><strong>do</strong></em> have personal insurance that covers theft, damage or involuntary and accidental parting for Your cell phone, this benefit reimburses You for the deductible portion of Your cell phone insurance.</p>
<p>If You <em><strong>do not</strong></em> have personal insurance, the benefit reimburses You for the covered theft, damage, or involuntary and accidental parting for Your cell phone.</p>
<p>Once all other insurance has been exhausted, Cellular Telephone Protection will provide coverage up to $500.00 per claim with a maximum of two (2) claims and $1,000.00 per twelve (12) month period. If it is determined that Your cell phone requires replacement due to the theft of, damage to or an involuntary or accidental parting of the device, You will receive the replacement value subject to the fifty dollar ($50.00) deductible and the benefit maximum. The replacement value is the lesser of Your cellular wireless service provider’s suggested retail value of a similar model replacement cell phone or the actual cost to replace  the cell phone.</p>
<p>If Your cell phone is repairable, You will receive an amount as determined by the diagnostic to repair the cell phone subject to the benefit maximum and fifty-dollar ($50.00) deductible.</p>
<p><em>Note: Electronic issues, such as inability to charge, mechanical or battery failure, where there is no evidence of physical damage, are not covered under this program.</em></p>
<h3>When does it apply?</h3>
<p>Cellular Telephone Protection applies when You make Your monthly cellular wireless phone bill payment with Your eligible card. Coverage begins the first day of the calendar month following a payment of the cellular wireless phone bill.</p>
<p>If You fail to make a cellular wireless phone bill payment in a particular month, Your coverage will be suspended. Coverage will resume on the first day of the calendar month after the date of any future cellular wireless phone bill payment made with the eligible card.</p>
<p><em><strong>If Your cell phone is stolen as a result of criminal activity, You must file a police report within forty-eight (48) hours of the event.</strong></em></p>
<h3>What is <em>not</em> covered?</h3>
<p>This benefit will not provide reimbursement for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cell phone accessories other than standard battery and/or standard antenna provided by the manufacturer</li>
<li>Cell phones purchased for resale, professional, or commercial use</li>
<li>Cell phones that are lost or “mysteriously disappear,” meaning that the phone vanished in an unexplained manner without evidence of a wrongful act by a person or persons</li>
<li>Cell phones under the care and control of a common carrier (including, but not limited to, the U.S. Postal Service, airplanes, or delivery service)</li>
<li>Cell phones stolen from baggage unless hand-carried and under Your personal supervision, or under supervision of Your traveling companion</li>
<li>Cell phones which have been rented, borrowed or are part of pre-paid or “pay as you go” type plans</li>
<li>Cosmetic damage to the cell phone or damage that does not impact the cell phone’s capabilities and functionalities</li>
<li>Damage or theft resulting from abuse, intentional acts, fraud, hostilities of any kind (including, but not limited to, war, invasion, rebellion, or insurrection), confiscation by the authorities, risks of contraband, illegal activities, normal wear and tear, flood, earthquake, radioactive contamination, or damage from inherent product defects</li>
<li>Damage or theft resulting from misdelivery or voluntary parting with the cell phone</li>
<li>Taxes, delivery and transportation charges, and any fees associated with the cellular wireless service provider</li>
