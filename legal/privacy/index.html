Information for Interest-Based Offers (including Personal Data) may be provided to us by you (such as through your use of the Services), or derived from the usage patterns of particular users on the Services and/or services of third parties. Such information may be gathered through tracking members’ activities across time and unaffiliated properties, such as when you use your Atlas Card at stores and merchants to complete purchases and transactions.</p>
</div> <div class="markdown" data-astro-cid-cnvtppup><h2>Data Security and Retention</h2>
<p>We seek to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use and disclosure using appropriate physical, technical, organizational and administrative security measures based on the type of Personal Data and how we are processing that data. You should also help protect your data by appropriately selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism; limiting access to your computer or device and browser; and signing off after you have finished accessing your account. Although we work to protect the security of your account and other data that we hold in our records, please be aware that no method of transmitting data over the internet or storing data is completely secure.</p>
<p>We retain Personal Data about you for as long as you have an open account with us or as otherwise necessary to provide you with our Services. In some cases we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. We may further retain information in an anonymous or aggregated form where that information would not identify you personally.</p>
</div> <div class="markdown" data-astro-cid-cnvtppup><h2>Personal Data of Children</h2>
<p>As noted in the Terms of Use, we do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data about children under 18 years of age; if you are a child under the age of 18, please do not attempt to register for or otherwise use the Services or send us any Personal Data. If we learn we have collected Personal Data from a child under 18 years of age, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 18 years of age may have provided Personal Data to us, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@atlascard.com">hello@atlascard.com</a>.</p>
</div> <div class="markdown" data-astro-cid-cnvtppup><h2>California Resident Rights</h2>
<p>If you are a California resident, you have the rights set forth in this section. Please see the “Exercising Your Rights” section below for instructions regarding how to exercise these rights. If we are processing your Personal Data as a service provider, you should contact the entity that collected your Personal Data in the first instance to address your rights with respect to such data.</p>
<p>If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Online Privacy Policy and you are a California resident, the portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following rights apply to you, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@atlascard.com">hello@atlascard.com</a>.</p>
<h3>Access</h3>
<p>You have the right to request certain information about our collection and use of your Personal Data over the past 12 months. In response, we will provide you with the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The categories of Personal Data that we have collected about you.</li>
<li>The categories of sources from which that Personal Data was collected.</li>
<li>The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your Personal Data.</li>
<li>The specific pieces of Personal Data that we have collected about you.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we have disclosed your Personal Data to any third parties for a business purpose over the past 12 months, we will identify the categories of Personal Data shared with each category of third party recipient. If we have sold your Personal Data over the past 12 months, we will identify the categories of Personal Data sold to each category of third party recipient.</p>
<h3>Deletion</h3>
<p>You have the right to request that we delete the Personal Data that we have collected about you. Under the CCPA, this right is subject to certain exceptions: for example, we may need to retain your Personal Data to provide you with the Services or complete a transaction or other action you have requested. If your deletion request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny your deletion request.</p>
<h3>Exercising Your Rights</h3>
<p>To exercise the rights described above, you or your Authorized Agent (defined below) must send us a request that (1) provides sufficient information to allow us to verify that you are the person about whom we have collected Personal Data, and (2) describes your request in sufficient detail to allow us to understand, evaluate and respond to it. Each request that meets both of these criteria will be considered a “Valid Request.” We may not respond to requests that do not meet these criteria. We will only use Personal Data provided in a Valid Request to verify your identity and complete your request. You do not need an account to submit a Valid Request.</p>
<p>We will work to respond to your Valid Request within 45 days of receipt. We will not charge you a fee for making a Valid Request unless your Valid Request(s) is excessive, repetitive or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the fee and explain that decision before completing your request.</p>
<p>You may submit a Valid Request using the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Call us at: <a href="tel:+14159410675">(415) 941-0675</a></li>
<li>Email us at: <a href="mailto:hello@atlascard.com">hello@atlascard.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You may also authorize an agent (an “Authorized Agent”) to exercise your rights on your behalf. To do this, you must provide your Authorized Agent with written permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, and we may request a copy of this written permission from your Authorized Agent when they make a request on your behalf.</p>
<h3>Personal Data Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In</h3>
<p>In this section, we use the term ‘sell’ as it is defined in the CCPA. where “sell,” “selling,” “sale,” or “sold,” means selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer’s personal information by the business to another business or a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration.” To the limited extent we “sell” your Personal Data (as described below) you have the right to opt-out of these sales.</p>
<p>As described in the “Tracking Tools, Advertising and Opt-Out” section above, we have incorporated Cookies from certain third parties into our Services. These Cookies allow those third parties to receive information about your activity on our Services that is associated with your browser or device. Those third parties may use that data to serve you relevant ads on our Services or on other websites you visit. Under the CCPA, sharing your data through third party Cookies for online advertising may be considered a “sale” of information. You can opt out of these sales by following the instructions in this section.</p>
<p>You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your Personal Data. You can opt-out using the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Call us at: <a href="tel:+14159410675">(415) 941-0675</a></li>
<li>Email us at: <a href="mailto:hello@atlascard.com">hello@atlascard.com</a></li>
<li>Text us at: (650) 539-2701</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have submitted an opt-out request, we will not ask you to reauthorize the sale of your Personal Data for at least 12 months. To our knowledge, we do not sell the Personal Data of minors under 16 years of age.</p>
<p><em><strong>We Will Not Discriminate Against You for Exercising Your Rights Under the CCPA</strong></em></p>
<p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. We will not deny you our goods or services, charge you different prices or rates, or provide you a lower quality of goods and services if you exercise your rights under the CCPA. However, we may offer different tiers of our Services as allowed by applicable data privacy laws (including the CCPA) with varying prices, rates or levels of quality of the goods or services you receive related to the value of Personal Data that we receive from you.</p>
