                        <p><strong>(d)</strong> <u>Aggregated Data.</u> We may also aggregate or otherwise strip information of all personally identifying characteristics and may share that aggregated, anonymized data with third parties or publish it.</p>

                        <p>We implement a combination of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards—including encryption, access controls, and regular security assessments—to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.</p>
                        <p>Despite diligent efforts, we cannot guarantee the security of any information that you submit to us through the Internet or that we electronically store. With that in mind, please use caution and discretion when determining what personal information to share with us.</p>
